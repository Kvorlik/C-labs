# C-labs
This repo contains laboratory works for the course "programming languages (C language)", relevant for 2017.

Although the source file extensions are .cpp, the program code is written using C syntax.

At this moment (see date of commit) some labs are out of date and aren't actual longer.

Due to the fact that the solutions were written relatively long ago, you may need to retarget the solution to a newer version of the Windows SDK (right click on solution -> retarget).
